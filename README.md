This interactive web project was inspired by my experience helping a friend with the visual design for her pet store, as well as by my own dog. The bouncing ball on the homepage is based on my dog’s appearance, and all visual elements—such as tennis balls, bowls filled with kibble, canned food, and collars—were hand-drawn by me. These illustrations aim to express warmth, playfulness, and a love for pets.

Users are invited to explore the site by clicking on the animated central ball, which is surrounded by rotating letters forming the words Grooming, Boarding, and Training. Clicking on any of these letters leads to a dedicated page for that service. The interaction is intuitive and playful, designed to engage curiosity.

The entire experience is built using p5.js for canvas-based graphics and interaction, combined with standard HTML navigation. I truly enjoyed the full journey of this project—from ideation and illustration to interaction and development—and it reflects my passion for both design and pets.

This website is not perfect, but I enjoyed the development process.![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/726253a4-113b-4a6f-a9ca-1db1140fcd79)
